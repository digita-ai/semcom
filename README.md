# Semantic Components

[![Build Status](https://github.com/digita-ai/semcom/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/digita-ai/semcom/actions)

The goal of this project is to construct a decentralised registry to support the dynamic binding of semantic components in Solid data browsers. This registry is based on insights of practical solutions such as OpenComponents and Bit.dev while using theoretical building blocks such as linked data shapes as a foundation.
